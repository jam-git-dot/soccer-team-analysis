# Soccerini V0.5 Development Plan

## Project Overview

Soccerini (working title) is a web-based application for analyzing and visualizing soccer team play styles. The application allows users to view radar charts and tables that display various metrics categorized by play style elements, providing context by comparing team stats to league averages.

V0.5 focuses on building a clean, simple interface using static data from a fictional "Developer League" with an emphasis on code modularity and the Single Responsibility Principle to allow for future extensibility.

## Key Principles

- **Data-first approach**: Focus on proper metric definition and organization
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should have one responsibility
- **Comparative context**: All metrics should provide league context
- **Simplicity over comprehensiveness**: Clean, focused UI over feature bloat
- **Future-proof structure**: Design for real data integration later

## Technical Decisions

### Metric Categories

For V0.5, we'll use these four core categories:
These categories are DEFINED in the src/config/constants.ts file. 
1. **Attacking** - Metrics related to scoring and creating chances
2. **Defending** - Metrics related to preventing opponents from scoring
3. **Possession & Build-up** - Metrics related to ball retention and progression
4. **Tempo & Transition** - Metrics related to speed of play and transitions between phases

### Data Architecture

- Static JSON files for mock team metrics data
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces mimicking potential future API responses
- Metrics dictionary with detailed metadata about each metric
- Service layer abstracting data access to ease future API integration
- Custom hooks for data fetching and transformation

### UI Technologies

- React for component library
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for visualization components
- React Router for navigation

### Approach to Metrics

- Raw values when intuitive to users (goals scored, etc.)
- Percentiles for context-dependent metrics (pressing intensity, etc.)
- Clear visual distinction between absolute and relative metrics
- Always provide league context for reference

## Future Improvements (beyond V0.5)

5. League summary dashboards
6. Match context filtering (home/away, win/loss)
7. Team similarity analysis
8. Season trend visualization
9. Expanded metric set
10. Backend database for data storage and API management
